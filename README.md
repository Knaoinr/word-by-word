# word-by-word

A MacOS app âœ¨

The iTunes lyrics font is too small and grainy for me to read anything outside the Roman alphabet, so I made this to make the font larger. It displays each word in time with its audio, making it easier to keep up and read faster.

Copy and paste lyrics into here, time them to go along with their audio, and read them!
